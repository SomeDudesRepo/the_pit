A single char array contains a number of strings. Each string is NULL terminated. After the final string, an additional NULL indicates the end of the char array (i.e. two consecutive NULLs occur only at this point). Provide C++ code to modify this array to ensure the strings appear in the same array sorted in ascending alphabetical order. You should pay attention to code clarity, but also be mindful of performance.
